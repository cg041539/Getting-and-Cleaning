# Code book for Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project

The data set that this code book pertains to is located in the `tidy_dataset.txt` file of this repository.

See the `README.md` file of this repository for background information on this data set.

The structure of the data set is described in the [Data](#data) section, its variables are listed in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the transformations that were carried out to obtain the data set based on the source data are presented in the [Transformations](#transformations) section.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

The `tidy_data.txt` data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables. 

## Variables <a name="variables"></a>

Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

### Identifiers <a name="identifiers"></a>

- `subject`

	Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

- `activity`

	Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values: 
	- `WALKING`: subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: subject was laying
	## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## Activity Labels

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test

## Transformations <a name="transformations"></a>
*Assign each data to variables

*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

*Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each  variable for each activity and each subject
